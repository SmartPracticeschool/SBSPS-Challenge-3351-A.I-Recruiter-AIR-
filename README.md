# SBSPS-Challenge-3351-A.I-Recruiter-AIR-
The proposed solution of an artificial intelligent recruitment system can be implemented at various circumstances. It can be implemented during layoffs so that the company will have only a preferred number of employees that are needed for the ongoing projects. College committees can implement this tool to select the required number of members that are fit to join that particular committee without investing a lot of their time. The artificial intelligent system  allows recruiters and hiring managers to make data-driven hiring decisions rather than decisions based on their gut feeling.This  system pulls fresh data consistently and retains and monitors every data point in one platform. It will pick up any pattern that was present earlier but hasnâ€™t been excluded by the algorithm yet. The proposed system supports a unified recruiting ecosystem.
